# Hybrid Cloud Networking

Configure secure, high-performance connectivity between on-premises and cloud environments using VPN, Direct Connect, and ExpressRoute.

## Do not use this skill when

- The task is unrelated to hybrid cloud networking
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope

## Instructions

- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
- Provide actionable steps and verification.
- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Purpose

Establish secure, reliable network connectivity between on-premises data centers and cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP).

## Use this skill when

- Connect on-premises to cloud
- Extend datacenter to cloud
- Implement hybrid active-active setups
- Meet compliance requirements
- Migrate to cloud gradually

## Connection Options

### AWS Connectivity

#### 1. Site-to-Site VPN
- IPSec VPN over internet
- Up to 1.25 Gbps per tunnel
- Cost-effective for moderate bandwidth
- Higher latency, internet-dependent

```hcl
resource "aws_vpn_gateway" "main" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id
  tags = {
    Name = "main-vpn-gateway"
  }
}

resource "aws_customer_gateway" "main" {
  bgp_asn    = 65000
  ip_address = "203.0.113.1"
  type       = "ipsec.1"
}

resource "aws_vpn_connection" "main" {
  vpn_gateway_id      = aws_vpn_gateway.main.id
  customer_gateway_id = aws_customer_gateway.main.id
  type                = "ipsec.1"
  static_routes_only  = false
}
```

#### 2. AWS Direct Connect
- Dedicated network connection
- 1 Gbps to 100 Gbps
- Lower latency, consistent bandwidth
- More expensive, setup time required

**Reference:** See `references/direct-connect.md`

### Azure Connectivity

#### 1. Site-to-Site VPN
```hcl
resource "azurerm_virtual_network_gateway" "vpn" {
  name                = "vpn-gateway"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.main.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.main.name

  type     = "Vpn"
  vpn_type = "RouteBased"
  sku      = "VpnGw1"

  ip_configuration {
    name                          = "vnetGatewayConfig"
    public_ip_address_id          = azurerm_public_ip.vpn.id
    private_ip_address_allocation = "Dynamic"
    subnet_id                     = azurerm_subnet.gateway.id
  }
}
```

#### 2. Azure ExpressRoute
- Private connection via connectivity provider
- Up to 100 Gbps
- Low latency, high reliability
- Premium for global connectivity

### GCP Connectivity

#### 1. Cloud VPN
- IPSec VPN (Classic or HA VPN)
- HA VPN: 99.99% SLA
- Up to 3 Gbps per tunnel

#### 2. Cloud Interconnect
- Dedicated (10 Gbps, 100 Gbps)
- Partner (50 Mbps to 50 Gbps)
- Lower latency than VPN
