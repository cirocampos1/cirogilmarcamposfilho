**IMPORTANT - Path Resolution:**
This skill can be installed in different locations (plugin system, manual installation, global, or project-specific). Before executing any commands, determine the skill directory based on where you loaded this SKILL.md file, and use that path in all commands below. Replace `$SKILL_DIR` with the actual discovered path.

Common installation paths:

- Plugin system: `<plugin-root>/skills/playwright-skill`
- Manual global: `<agent-home>/skills/playwright-skill`
- Project-specific: `<project>/.agent/skills/playwright-skill`

# Playwright Browser Automation

General-purpose browser automation skill. I'll write custom Playwright code for any automation task you request and execute it via the universal executor.

**CRITICAL WORKFLOW - Follow these steps in order:**

1. **Auto-detect dev servers** - For localhost testing, ALWAYS run server detection FIRST:

   ```bash
   cd $SKILL_DIR && node -e "require('./lib/helpers').detectDevServers().then(servers => console.log(JSON.stringify(servers)))"
   ```

   - If **1 server found**: Use it automatically, inform user
   - If **multiple servers found**: Ask user which one to test
   - If **no servers found**: Ask for URL or offer to help start dev server

2. **Write scripts to /tmp** - NEVER write test files to skill directory; always use `/tmp/playwright-test-*.js`

3. **Use visible browser by default** - Always use `headless: false` unless user specifically requests headless mode

4. **Parameterize URLs** - Always make URLs configurable via environment variable or constant at top of script

## How It Works

1. You describe what you want to test/automate
2. I auto-detect running dev servers (or ask for URL if testing external site)
3. I write custom Playwright code in `/tmp/playwright-test-*.js` (won't clutter your project)
4. I execute it via: `cd $SKILL_DIR && node run.js /tmp/playwright-test-*.js`
5. Results displayed in real-time, browser window visible for debugging
6. Test files auto-cleaned from /tmp by your OS

## Setup (First Time)

```bash
cd $SKILL_DIR
npm run setup
```

This installs Playwright and Chromium browser. Only needed once.

## Execution Pattern

**Step 1: Detect dev servers (for localhost testing)**

```bash
cd $SKILL_DIR && node -e "require('./lib/helpers').detectDevServers().then(s => console.log(JSON.stringify(s)))"
```

**Step 2: Write test script to /tmp with URL parameter**

```javascript
// /tm
