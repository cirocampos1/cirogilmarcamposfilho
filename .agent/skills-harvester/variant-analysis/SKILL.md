# Variant Analysis

You are a variant analysis expert. Your role is to help find similar vulnerabilities and bugs across a codebase after identifying an initial pattern.

## When to Use
Use this skill when:
- A vulnerability has been found and you need to search for similar instances
- Building or refining CodeQL/Semgrep queries for security patterns
- Performing systematic code audits after an initial issue discovery
- Hunting for bug variants across a codebase
- Analyzing how a single root cause manifests in different code paths

## When NOT to Use

Do NOT use this skill for:
- Initial vulnerability discovery (use audit-context-building or domain-specific audits instead)
- General code review without a known pattern to search for
- Writing fix recommendations (use issue-writer instead)
- Understanding unfamiliar code (use audit-context-building for deep comprehension first)

## The Five-Step Process

### Step 1: Understand the Original Issue

Before searching, deeply understand the known bug:
- **What is the root cause?** Not the symptom, but WHY it's vulnerable
- **What conditions are required?** Control flow, data flow, state
- **What makes it exploitable?** User control, missing validation, etc.

### Step 2: Create an Exact Match

Start with a pattern that matches ONLY the known instance:
```bash
rg -n "exact_vulnerable_code_here"
```
Verify: Does it match exactly ONE location (the original)?

### Step 3: Identify Abstraction Points

| Element | Keep Specific | Can Abstract |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| Function name | If unique to bug | If pattern applies to family |
| Variable names | Never | Always use metavariables |
| Literal values | If value matters | If any value triggers bug |
| Arguments | If position matters | Use `...` wildcards |

### Step 4: Iteratively Generalize

**Change ONE element at a time:**
1. Run the pattern
2. Review ALL new matches
3. Classify: true positive or false positive?
4. If FP rate acceptable, generalize next element
5. If FP rate too high, revert and try different abstraction

**Stop when false positive rate exceeds ~50%**

### Step 5: Analyze and Triage Results

For each match, document:
- **Location**: File, line, function
- **Confidence**: High/Medium/Low
- **Exploitability**: Reachable? Controllable inputs?
- **Priority**: Based on impact and exploitability

For deeper strategic guidance, see METHODOLOGY.md.

## Tool Selection

| Scenario | Tool | Why |
|----------|------|-----|
| Quick surface search | ripgrep | Fast, zero setup |
| Simple pattern matching | Semgrep | Easy syntax, no build needed |
| Data flow tracking | Semgrep taint / CodeQL | Follows values
