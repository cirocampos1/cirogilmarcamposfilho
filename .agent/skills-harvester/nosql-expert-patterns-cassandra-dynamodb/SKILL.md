# NoSQL Expert Patterns (Cassandra & DynamoDB)

## Overview

This skill provides professional mental models and design patterns for **distributed wide-column and key-value stores** (specifically Apache Cassandra and Amazon DynamoDB).

Unlike SQL (where you model data entities), or document stores (like MongoDB), these distributed systems require you to **model your queries first**.

## When to Use
- **Designing for Scale**: Moving beyond simple single-node databases to distributed clusters.
- **Technology Selection**: Evaluating or using **Cassandra**, **ScyllaDB**, or **DynamoDB**.
- **Performance Tuning**: Troubleshooting "hot partitions" or high latency in existing NoSQL systems.
- **Microservices**: Implementing "database-per-service" patterns where highly optimized reads are required.

## The Mental Shift: SQL vs. Distributed NoSQL

| Feature | SQL (Relational) | Distributed NoSQL (Cassandra/DynamoDB) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data modeling** | Model Entities + Relationships | Model **Queries** (Access Patterns) |
| **Joins** | CPU-intensive, at read time | **Pre-computed** (Denormalized) at write time |
| **Storage cost** | Expensive (minimize duplication) | Cheap (duplicate data for read speed) |
| **Consistency** | ACID (Strong) | **BASE (Eventual)** / Tunable |
| **Scalability** | Vertical (Bigger machine) | **Horizontal** (More nodes/shards) |

> **The Golden Rule:** In SQL, you design the data model to answer *any* query. In NoSQL, you design the data model to answer *specific* queries efficiently.

## Core Design Patterns

### 1. Query-First Modeling (Access Patterns)

You typically cannot "add a query later" without migration or creating a new table/index.

**Process:**
1.  **List all Entities** (User, Order, Product).
2.  **List all Access Patterns** ("Get User by Email", "Get Orders by User sorted by Date").
3.  **Design Table(s)** specifically to serve those patterns with a single lookup.

### 2. The Partition Key is King

Data is distributed across physical nodes based on the **Partition Key (PK)**.
-   **Goal:** Even distribution of data and traffic.
-   **Anti-Pattern:** Using a low-cardinality PK (e.g., `status="active"` or `gender="m"`) creates **Hot Partitions**, limiting throughput to a single node's capacity.
-   **Best Practice:** Use high-cardinality keys (User IDs, Device IDs, Composite Keys).

### 3. Clustering / Sort Keys

Within a partition, data is sorted on disk by the **Clustering Key (Cassandra)** or **Sort Key (DynamoDB)**.
-   This allows for efficient **Range Queries** (e.g., `WHERE user_id=X AND date > Y`).
-   It effectively pre-sorts your data for specific retrieval requirements.

### 4. Single-Table Design (Adjacency
