# Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)

## Overview

A Progressive Web App is a web application that uses modern browser capabilities to deliver a fast, reliable, and installable experience — even on unreliable networks. The three required pillars are:

1. **HTTPS** — Required in production for service workers to register (localhost is exempt for development).
2. **Web App Manifest** (`manifest.json`) — Makes the app installable and defines its appearance on device home screens.
3. **Service Worker** (`sw.js`) — A background script that intercepts network requests, manages caches, and enables offline functionality.

## When to Use This Skill

- Use when the user wants their web app to work offline or on unreliable networks.
- Use when building a mobile-first web project where users should be able to install the app to their home screen.
- Use when the user asks about caching strategies, service workers, or improving web app performance and resilience.
- Use when the user mentions Workbox, web app manifests, background sync, or push notifications for the web.
- Use when the user asks "can my website be installed like an app?" or "how do I make my site work offline?" — even if they don't use the word PWA.

## Deliverables Checklist

Every PWA implementation must include these files at minimum:

- [ ] `index.html` — Links manifest, registers service worker
- [ ] `manifest.json` — Full app metadata and icon set
- [ ] `sw.js` — Service worker with install, activate, and fetch handlers
- [ ] `app.js` — Main app logic with SW registration and install prompt handling
- [ ] `offline.html` — Fallback page shown when navigation fails offline (required — missing file will cause install to fail)

## Step 1: Web App Manifest (`manifest.json`)

Defines how the app appears when installed. Must be linked from `<head>` via `<link rel="manifest">`.
