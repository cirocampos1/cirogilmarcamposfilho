# Radix UI Design System

Build production-ready, accessible design systems using Radix UI primitives with full customization control and zero style opinions.

## Overview

Radix UI provides unstyled, accessible components (primitives) that you can customize to match any design system. This skill guides you through building scalable component libraries with Radix UI, focusing on accessibility-first design, theming architecture, and composable patterns.

**Key Strengths:**
- **Headless by design**: Full styling control without fighting defaults
- **Accessibility built-in**: WAI-ARIA compliant, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- **Composable primitives**: Build complex components from simple building blocks
- **Framework agnostic**: Works with React, but styles work anywhere

## When to Use This Skill

- Creating a custom design system from scratch
- Building accessible UI component libraries
- Implementing complex interactive components (Dialog, Dropdown, Tabs, etc.)
- Migrating from styled component libraries to unstyled primitives
- Setting up theming systems with CSS variables or Tailwind
- Need full control over component behavior and styling
- Building applications requiring WCAG 2.1 AA/AAA compliance

## Do not use this skill when

- You need pre-styled components out of the box (use shadcn/ui, Mantine, etc.)
- Building simple static pages without interactivity
- The project doesn't use React 16.8+ (Radix requires hooks)
- You need components for frameworks other than React

## Core Principles

### 1. Accessibility First

Every Radix primitive is built with accessibility as the foundation:

- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support (Tab, Arrow keys, Enter, Escape)
- **Screen Readers**: Proper ARIA attributes and live regions
- **Focus Management**: Automatic focus trapping and restoration
- **Disabled States**: Proper handling of disabled and aria-disabled

**Rule**: Never override accessibility features. Enhance, don't replace.

### 2. Headless Architecture

Radix provides **behavior**, you provide **appearance**:

```tsx
// ❌ Don't fight pre-styled components
<Button className="override-everything" />

// ✅ Radix gives you behavior, you add styling
<Dialog.Root>
  <Dialog.Trigger className="your-button-styles" />
  <Dialog.Content className="your-modal-styles" />
</Dialog.Root>
```

### 3. Composition Over Configuration

Build complex components from simple primitives:

```tsx
// Primitive components compose naturally
<Tabs.Root>
  <Tabs.List>
    <Tabs.Trigger value="tab1">Tab 1</Tabs.Trigger>
    <Tabs.Trigger value="tab2">Tab 2</Tabs.Trigger>
  </Tabs.List>
  <Tabs.Content value="tab1">Content 1</Tabs.Content>
  <Tabs.Content value="tab2">
