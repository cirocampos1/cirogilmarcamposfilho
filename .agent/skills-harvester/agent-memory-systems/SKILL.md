# Agent Memory Systems

Memory is the cornerstone of intelligent agents. Without it, every interaction
starts from zero. This skill covers the architecture of agent memory: short-term
(context window), long-term (vector stores), and the cognitive architectures
that organize them.

Key insight: Memory isn't just storage - it's retrieval. A million stored facts
mean nothing if you can't find the right one. Chunking, embedding, and retrieval
strategies determine whether your agent remembers or forgets.

The field is fragmented with inconsistent terminology. We use the CoALA cognitive
architecture framework: semantic memory (facts), episodic memory (experiences),
and procedural memory (how-to knowledge).

## Principles

- Memory quality = retrieval quality, not storage quantity
- Chunk for retrieval, not for storage
- Context isolation is the enemy of memory
- Right memory type for right information
- Decay old memories - not everything should be forever
- Test retrieval accuracy before production
- Background memory formation beats real-time

## Scope

- vector-database-operations → data-engineer
- rag-pipeline-architecture → llm-architect
- embedding-model-selection → ml-engineer
- knowledge-graph-design → knowledge-engineer

## Tooling

### Memory_frameworks

- LangMem (LangChain) - When: LangGraph agents with persistent memory Note: Semantic, episodic, procedural memory types
- MemGPT / Letta - When: Virtual context management, OS-style memory Note: Hierarchical memory tiers, automatic paging
- Mem0 - When: User memory layer for personalization Note: Designed for user preferences and history

### Vector_stores

- Pinecone - When: Managed, enterprise-scale (billions of vectors) Note: Best query performance, highest cost
- Qdrant - When: Complex metadata filtering, open-source Note: Rust-based, excellent filtering
- Weaviate - When: Hybrid search, knowledge graph features Note: GraphQL interface, good for relationships
- ChromaDB - When: Prototyping, small/medium apps Note: Developer-friendly, ~20ms p50 at 100K vectors
- pgvector - When: Already using PostgreSQL, simpler setup Note: Good for <1M vectors, familiar tooling

### Embedding_models

- OpenAI text-embedding-3-large - When: Best quality, 3072 dimensions Note: $0.13/1M tokens
- OpenAI text-embedding-3-small - When: Good balance, 1536 dimensions Note: $0.02/1M tokens, 5x cheaper
- nomic-embed-text-v1.5 - When: O
