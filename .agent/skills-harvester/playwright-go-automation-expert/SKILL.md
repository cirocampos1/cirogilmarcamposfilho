# Playwright Go Automation Expert

## Overview
This skill provides a comprehensive framework for writing high-performance, production-grade browser automation scripts using `github.com/playwright-community/playwright-go`. It enforces architectural best practices (contexts over instances), robust error handling, structured logging (Zap), and advanced human-emulation techniques to bypass anti-bot systems.

## When to Use This Skill
- Use when the user asks to "scrape," "automate," or "test" a website using Go.
- Use when the target site has complex dynamic content (SPA, React, Vue) requiring a real browser.
- Use when the user mentions "stealth," "avoiding detection," "cloudflare," or "human-like" behavior.
- Use when debugging existing Playwright scripts.

## Safety & Risk
**Risk Level: 🔵 Safe**

- **Sandboxed Execution:** Browser contexts are isolated; they do not persist data to the host machine unless explicitly saved.
- **Resource Management:** Designed to close browsers and contexts via `defer` to prevent memory leaks.
- **No External State-Change:** Default behavior is read-only (scraping/testing) unless the script is explicitly designed to submit forms or modify data.

## Limitations
- **Environment Dependencies:** Requires Playwright drivers and browsers to be installed (`go run github.com/playwright-community/playwright-go/cmd/playwright@latest install --with-deps`).
- **Resource Intensity:** Launching full browser instances (even headless) consumes significant RAM/CPU. Use single-browser/multi-context architecture.
- **Bot Detection:** While this skill includes stealth techniques, extremely strict anti-bot systems (e.g., rigorous Cloudflare settings) may still detect automation.
- **CAPTCHAs:** Does not include built-in CAPTCHA solving capabilities.

## Strategic Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Architecture: Contexts vs. Browsers
**CRITICAL:** Never launch a new `Browser` instance for every task.
- **Pattern:** Launch the `Browser` *once* (singleton). Create a new `BrowserContext` for each distinct session or task.
- **Why:** Contexts are lightweight and created in milliseconds. Browsers take seconds to launch.
- **Isolation:** Contexts provide complete isolation (cookies, cache, storage) without the overhead of a new process.

### 2. Logging & Observability
- **Library:** Use `go.uber.org/zap` exclusively.
- **Rule:** Do not use `fmt.Println`.
- **Modes:**
  - **Dev:** `zap.NewDevelopment()` (Console friendly)
  - **Prod:** `zap.NewProduction()` (JSON structured)
- **Traceability:** Log every navigation, click, and input with context fields (e.g., `logger.Info("clicking button", zap.String("selector", sel))`).

### 3. Error Handling & Stability
- **Graceful Shutdown:** Always use `defer` to close Page
