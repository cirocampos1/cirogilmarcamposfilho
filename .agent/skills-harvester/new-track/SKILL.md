# New Track

Create a new track (feature, bug fix, chore, or refactor) with a detailed specification and phased implementation plan.

## Use this skill when

- Working on new track tasks or workflows
- Needing guidance, best practices, or checklists for new track

## Do not use this skill when

- The task is unrelated to new track
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope

## Instructions

- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
- Provide actionable steps and verification.
- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Pre-flight Checks

1. Verify Conductor is initialized:
   - Check `conductor/product.md` exists
   - Check `conductor/tech-stack.md` exists
   - Check `conductor/workflow.md` exists
   - If missing: Display error and suggest running `/conductor:setup` first

2. Load context files:
   - Read `conductor/product.md` for product context
   - Read `conductor/tech-stack.md` for technical context
   - Read `conductor/workflow.md` for TDD/commit preferences

## Track Classification

Determine track type based on description or ask user:

```
What type of track is this?

1. Feature - New functionality
2. Bug - Fix for existing issue
3. Chore - Maintenance, dependencies, config
4. Refactor - Code improvement without behavior change
```

## Interactive Specification Gathering

**CRITICAL RULES:**

- Ask ONE question per turn
- Wait for user response before proceeding
- Tailor questions based on track type
- Maximum 6 questions total

### For Feature Tracks

**Q1: Feature Summary**

```
Describe the feature in 1-2 sentences.
[If argument provided, confirm: "You want to: {argument}. Is this correct?"]
```

**Q2: User Story**

```
Who benefits and how?

Format: As a [user type], I want to [action] so that [benefit].
```

**Q3: Acceptance Criteria**

```
What must be true for this feature to be complete?

List 3-5 acceptance criteria (one per line):
```

**Q4: Dependencies**

```
Does this depend on any existing code, APIs, or other tracks?

1. No dependencies
2. Depends on existing code (specify)
3. Depends on incomplete track (specify)
```

**Q5: Scope Boundaries**

```
What is explicitly OUT of scope for this track?
(Helps prevent scope creep)
```

**Q6: Technical Considerations (optional)**

```
Any specific technical approach or constraints?
(Press enter to skip)
```

### For Bug Tracks

**Q1: Bug Summary**

```
What is broken?
[If argument provided, confirm]
```

**Q2: Steps to Reproduce**

```
How can this bug be reproduced?
List steps:
```

**Q3: Expected vs Actual Behavior**

```
What should happen vs what actually happens?
```

**Q4: Affected Areas**

```
What parts of the system are affected?
```

**Q5: Root Cause Hypothesis (optional)**

```
