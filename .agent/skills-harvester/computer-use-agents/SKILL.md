# Computer Use Agents

Build AI agents that interact with computers like humans do - viewing screens,
moving cursors, clicking buttons, and typing text. Covers Anthropic's Computer
Use, OpenAI's Operator/CUA, and open-source alternatives. Critical focus on
sandboxing, security, and handling the unique challenges of vision-based control.

## Patterns

### Perception-Reasoning-Action Loop

The fundamental architecture of computer use agents: observe screen,
reason about next action, execute action, repeat. This loop integrates
vision models with action execution through an iterative pipeline.

Key components:
1. PERCEPTION: Screenshot captures current screen state
2. REASONING: Vision-language model analyzes and plans
3. ACTION: Execute mouse/keyboard operations
4. FEEDBACK: Observe result, continue or correct

Critical insight: Vision agents are completely still during "thinking"
phase (1-5 seconds), creating a detectable pause pattern.

**When to use**: Building any computer use agent from scratch,Integrating vision models with desktop control,Understanding agent behavior patterns
