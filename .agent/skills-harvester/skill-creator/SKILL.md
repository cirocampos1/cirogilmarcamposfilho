# Skill Creator

Guide for creating skills that extend AI agent capabilities, with emphasis on Azure SDKs and Microsoft Foundry.

> **Required Context:** When creating SDK or API skills, users MUST provide the SDK package name, documentation URL, or repository reference for the skill to be based on.

## About Skills

Skills are modular knowledge packages that transform general-purpose agents into specialized experts:

1. **Procedural knowledge** — Multi-step workflows for specific domains
2. **SDK expertise** — API patterns, authentication, error handling for Azure services
3. **Domain context** — Schemas, business logic, company-specific patterns
4. **Bundled resources** — Scripts, references, templates for complex tasks

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Concise is Key

The context window is a shared resource. Challenge each piece: "Does this justify its token cost?"

**Default assumption: Agents are already capable.** Only add what they don't already know.

### 2. Fresh Documentation First

**Azure SDKs change constantly.** Skills should instruct agents to verify documentation:

```markdown
## Before Implementation

Search `microsoft-docs` MCP for current API patterns:
- Query: "[SDK name] [operation] python"
- Verify: Parameters match your installed SDK version
```

### 3. Degrees of Freedom

Match specificity to task fragility:

| Freedom | When | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| **High** | Multiple valid approaches | Text guidelines |
| **Medium** | Preferred pattern with variation | Pseudocode |
| **Low** | Must be exact | Specific scripts |

### 4. Progressive Disclosure

Skills load in three levels:

1. **Metadata** (~100 words) — Always in context
2. **SKILL.md body** (<5k words) — When skill triggers
3. **References** (unlimited) — As needed

**Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines.** Split into reference files when approaching this limit.

## Skill Structure

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md (required)
│   ├── YAML frontmatter (name, description)
│   └── Markdown instructions
└── Bundled Resources (optional)
    ├── scripts/      — Executable code
    ├── references/   — Documentation loaded as needed
    └── assets/       — Output resources (templates, images)
```

### SKILL.md

- **Frontmatter**: `name` and `description`. The description is the trigger mechanism.
- **Body**: Instructions loaded only after triggering.

### Bundled Resources

| Type | Purpose | When to Include |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| `scripts/` | Deterministic operations | Same code rewritten repeatedly |
| `references/` | Detailed patterns | API docs, schemas, detailed guides |
| `assets/` | Output resources | Templates, images, boilerplate |

**Don't include**: README.md, CHANGELO
