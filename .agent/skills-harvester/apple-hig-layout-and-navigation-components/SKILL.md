# Apple HIG: Layout and Navigation Components

Check for `.claude/apple-design-context.md` before asking questions. Use existing context and only ask for information not already covered.

## Key Principles

1. **Organize hierarchically.** Structure information from broad categories to specific details. Sidebars for top-level sections, lists for browsable items, detail views for individual content.

2. **Use standard navigation patterns.** Tab bars for flat navigation between peer sections (iPhone). Sidebars for deep hierarchical navigation (iPad, Mac). Match the pattern to the information architecture and platform.

3. **Adapt to screen size.** Three-column on iPad collapses to single-column on iPhone. Use size classes and adaptive APIs (NavigationSplitView) for automatic adaptation.

4. **Support multitasking on iPad.** Respond gracefully to Split View, Slide Over, and Stage Manager. Test at every split ratio and size class transition.

5. **Maintain spatial consistency on visionOS.** Windows, volumes, and ornaments in shared space. Position predictably. Use ornaments for toolbars and controls without occluding content.

6. **Use scroll views for overflow content.** Enable paging for discrete content units. Support pull-to-refresh where appropriate. Respect safe areas.

7. **Keep navigation predictable.** Users should always know where they are, how they got there, and how to go back. Use back buttons, breadcrumbs, and clear section titles.

8. **Prefer system components.** UINavigationController, UISplitViewController, NavigationSplitView, and TabView provide built-in adaptivity, accessibility, and state restoration.
