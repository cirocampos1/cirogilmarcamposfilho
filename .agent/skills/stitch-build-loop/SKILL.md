# Stitch Build Loop

You are an **autonomous frontend builder** participating in an iterative site-building loop. Your goal is to generate a page using Stitch, integrate it into the site, and prepare instructions for the next iteration.

## When to Use

- You are iteratively building a website with Stitch using a baton-based loop across runs or agents.
- Each pass should read the next prompt, generate or integrate a page, and hand off the next task.
- You need a disciplined autonomous loop for multi-step frontend site construction.

## Overview

The Build Loop pattern enables continuous, autonomous website development through a "baton" system. Each iteration:
1. Reads the current task from a baton file (`.stitch/next-prompt.md`)
2. Generates a page using Stitch MCP tools
3. Integrates the page into the site structure
4. Writes the next task to the baton file for the next iteration

## Prerequisites

**Required:**
- Access to the Stitch MCP Server
- A Stitch project (existing or will be created)
- A `.stitch/DESIGN.md` file (generate one using the `design-md` skill if needed)
- A `.stitch/SITE.md` file documenting the site vision and roadmap

**Optional:**
- Chrome DevTools MCP Server — enables visual verification of generated pages

## The Baton System

The `.stitch/next-prompt.md` file acts as a relay baton between iterations:

```markdown
---
page: about
---
A page describing how jules.top tracking works.

**DESIGN SYSTEM (REQUIRED):**
[Copy from .stitch/DESIGN.md Section 6]

**Page Structure:**
1. Header with navigation
2. Explanation of tracking methodology
3. Footer with links
```

**Critical rules:**
- The `page` field in YAML frontmatter determines the output filename
- The prompt content must include the design system block from `.stitch/DESIGN.md`
- You MUST update this file before completing your work to continue the loop

## Execution Protocol

### Step 1: Read the Baton

Parse `.stitch/next-prompt.md` to extract:
- **Page name** from the `page` frontmatter field
- **Prompt content** from the markdown body

### Step 2: Consult Context Files

Before generating, read these files:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.stitch/SITE.md` | Site vision, **Stitch Project ID**, existing pages (sitemap), roadmap |
| `.stitch/DESIGN.md` | Required visual style for Stitch prompts |

**Important checks:**
- Section 4 (Sitemap) — Do NOT recreate pages that already exist
- Section 5 (Roadmap) — Pick tasks from here if backlog exists
- Section 6 (Creative Freedom) — Ideas for new pages if roadmap is empty

### Step 3: Generate with Stitch

Use the Stitch MCP tools to generate the page:

1. **Discover namespace**: Run `list_tools` to find the Stitch MCP prefix
2. **Get or create project**:
