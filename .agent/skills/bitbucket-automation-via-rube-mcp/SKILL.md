# Bitbucket Automation via Rube MCP

Automate Bitbucket operations including repository management, pull request workflows, branch operations, issue tracking, and workspace administration through Composio's Bitbucket toolkit.

## Prerequisites

- Rube MCP must be connected (RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS available)
- Active Bitbucket connection via `RUBE_MANAGE_CONNECTIONS` with toolkit `bitbucket`
- Always call `RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS` first to get current tool schemas

## Setup

**Get Rube MCP**: Add `https://rube.app/mcp` as an MCP server in your client configuration. No API keys needed — just add the endpoint and it works.

1. Verify Rube MCP is available by confirming `RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS` responds
2. Call `RUBE_MANAGE_CONNECTIONS` with toolkit `bitbucket`
3. If connection is not ACTIVE, follow the returned auth link to complete Bitbucket OAuth
4. Confirm connection status shows ACTIVE before running any workflows

## Core Workflows

### 1. Manage Pull Requests

**When to use**: User wants to create, review, or inspect pull requests

**Tool sequence**:
1. `BITBUCKET_LIST_WORKSPACES` - Discover accessible workspaces [Prerequisite]
2. `BITBUCKET_LIST_REPOSITORIES_IN_WORKSPACE` - Find the target repository [Prerequisite]
3. `BITBUCKET_LIST_BRANCHES` - Verify source and destination branches exist [Prerequisite]
4. `BITBUCKET_CREATE_PULL_REQUEST` - Create a new PR with title, source branch, and optional reviewers [Required]
5. `BITBUCKET_LIST_PULL_REQUESTS` - List PRs filtered by state (OPEN, MERGED, DECLINED) [Optional]
6. `BITBUCKET_GET_PULL_REQUEST` - Get full details of a specific PR by ID [Optional]
7. `BITBUCKET_GET_PULL_REQUEST_DIFF` - Fetch unified diff for code review [Optional]
8. `BITBUCKET_GET_PULL_REQUEST_DIFFSTAT` - Get changed files with lines added/removed [Optional]

**Key parameters**:
- `workspace`: Workspace slug or UUID (required for all operations)
- `repo_slug`: URL-friendly repository name
- `source_branch`: Branch with changes to merge
- `destination_branch`: Target branch (defaults to repo main branch if omitted)
- `reviewers`: List of objects with `uuid` field for reviewer assignment
- `state`: Filter for LIST_PULL_REQUESTS - `OPEN`, `MERGED`, or `DECLINED`
- `max_chars`: Truncation limit for GET_PULL_REQUEST_DIFF to handle large diffs

**Pitfalls**:
- `reviewers` expects an array of objects with `uuid` key, NOT usernames: `[{"uuid": "{...}"}]`
- UUID format must include curly braces: `{123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000}`
- `destination_branch` defaults to the repo's main branch if omitted, which may not be `main`
- `pull_request_id` is an integer for GET/DIFF operations but comes back as part of PR listing
- Large diffs can overwhelm context; always set `max_chars` (e.
