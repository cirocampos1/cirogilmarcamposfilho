# Planning with Files

Work like Manus: Use persistent markdown files as your "working memory on disk."

## Important: Where Files Go

When using this skill:

- **Templates** are stored in the skill directory at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/`
- **Your planning files** (`task_plan.md`, `findings.md`, `progress.md`) should be created in **your project directory** — the folder where you're working

| Location | What Goes There |
|----------|-----------------|
| Skill directory (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/`) | Templates, scripts, reference docs |
| Your project directory | `task_plan.md`, `findings.md`, `progress.md` |

This ensures your planning files live alongside your code, not buried in the skill installation folder.

## Quick Start

Before ANY complex task:

1. **Create `task_plan.md`** in your project — Use [templates/task_plan.md](templates/task_plan.md) as reference
2. **Create `findings.md`** in your project — Use [templates/findings.md](templates/findings.md) as reference
3. **Create `progress.md`** in your project — Use [templates/progress.md](templates/progress.md) as reference
4. **Re-read plan before decisions** — Refreshes goals in attention window
5. **Update after each phase** — Mark complete, log errors

> **Note:** All three planning files should be created in your current working directory (your project root), not in the skill's installation folder.

## The Core Pattern

```
Context Window = RAM (volatile, limited)
Filesystem = Disk (persistent, unlimited)

→ Anything important gets written to disk.
```

## File Purposes

| File | Purpose | When to Update |
|------|---------|----------------|
| `task_plan.md` | Phases, progress, decisions | After each phase |
| `findings.md` | Research, discoveries | After ANY discovery |
| `progress.md` | Session log, test results | Throughout session |

## Critical Rules

### 1. Create Plan First
Never start a complex task without `task_plan.md`. Non-negotiable.

### 2. The 2-Action Rule
> "After every 2 view/browser/search operations, IMMEDIATELY save key findings to text files."

This prevents visual/multimodal information from being lost.

### 3. Read Before Decide
Before major decisions, read the plan file. This keeps goals in your attention window.

### 4. Update After Act
After completing any phase:
- Mark phase status: `in_progress` → `complete`
- Log any errors encountered
- Note files created/modified

### 5. Log ALL Errors
Every error goes in the plan file. This builds knowledge and prevents repetition.

```markdown
## Errors Encountered
| Error | Attempt | Resolution |
|-------|---------|------------|
| FileNotFoundError | 1 | Created default config |
| API timeout | 2 | Added retry logic |
```

### 6. Never Repeat Failures
```
if action_failed:
    next_action != same_action
```
Track what you tr
