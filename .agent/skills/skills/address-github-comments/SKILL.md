# Address GitHub Comments

## Overview

Efficiently address PR review comments or issue feedback using the GitHub CLI (`gh`). This skill ensures all feedback is addressed systematically.

## Prerequisites

Ensure `gh` is authenticated.

```bash
gh auth status
```

If not logged in, run `gh auth login`.

## Workflow

### 1. Inspect Comments

Fetch the comments for the current branch's PR.

```bash
gh pr view --comments
```

Or use a custom script if available to list threads.

### 2. Categorize and Plan

- List the comments and review threads.
- Propose a fix for each.
- **Wait for user confirmation** on which comments to address first if there are many.

### 3. Apply Fixes

Apply the code changes for the selected comments.

### 4. Respond to Comments

Once fixed, respond to the threads as resolved.

```bash
gh pr comment <PR_NUMBER> --body "Addressed in latest commit."
```

## Common Mistakes

- **Applying fixes without understanding context**: Always read the surrounding code of a comment.
- **Not verifying auth**: Check `gh auth status` before starting.


## 🚀 Option B: Efficiency Guidelines (MANDATORY)

1. **Direct Action**: Never explain what you are going to do. Just do it.
2. **Token Economy**: Minimize chatter. Use the most concise tool calls possible.
3. **Verification First**: Run validation scripts immediately after any change.
4. **GPU Acceleration**: Use local GPU/Ollama for heavy analysis tasks when possible.
