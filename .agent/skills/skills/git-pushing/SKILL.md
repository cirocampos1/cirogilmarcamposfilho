# Git Push Workflow

Stage all changes, create a conventional commit, and push to the remote branch.

## When to Use

Automatically activate when the user:

- Explicitly asks to push changes ("push this", "commit and push")
- Mentions saving work to remote ("save to github", "push to remote")
- Completes a feature and wants to share it
- Says phrases like "let's push this up" or "commit these changes"

## Workflow

**ALWAYS use the script** - do NOT use manual git commands:

```bash
bash skills/git-pushing/scripts/smart_commit.sh
```

With custom message:

```bash
bash skills/git-pushing/scripts/smart_commit.sh "feat: add feature"
```

Script handles: staging, conventional commit message, Claude footer, push with -u flag.


## 🚀 Option B: Efficiency Guidelines (MANDATORY)

1. **Direct Action**: Never explain what you are going to do. Just do it.
2. **Token Economy**: Minimize chatter. Use the most concise tool calls possible.
3. **Verification First**: Run validation scripts immediately after any change.
4. **GPU Acceleration**: Use local GPU/Ollama for heavy analysis tasks when possible.
