# Shopify Apps

## Patterns

### React Router App Setup

Modern Shopify app template with React Router

### Embedded App with App Bridge

Render app embedded in Shopify Admin

### Webhook Handling

Secure webhook processing with HMAC verification

## Anti-Patterns

### ❌ REST API for New Apps

### ❌ Webhook Processing Before Response

### ❌ Polling Instead of Webhooks

## ⚠️ Sharp Edges

| Issue | Severity | Solution |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Issue | high | ## Respond immediately, process asynchronously |
| Issue | high | ## Check rate limit headers |
| Issue | high | ## Request protected customer data access |
| Issue | medium | ## Use TOML only (recommended) |
| Issue | medium | ## Handle both URL formats |
| Issue | high | ## Use GraphQL for all new code |
| Issue | high | ## Use latest App Bridge via script tag |
| Issue | high | ## Implement all GDPR handlers |


## 🚀 Option B: Efficiency Guidelines (MANDATORY)

1. **Direct Action**: Never explain what you are going to do. Just do it.
2. **Token Economy**: Minimize chatter. Use the most concise tool calls possible.
3. **Verification First**: Run validation scripts immediately after any change.
4. **GPU Acceleration**: Use local GPU/Ollama for heavy analysis tasks when possible.
