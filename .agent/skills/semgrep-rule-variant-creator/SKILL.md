# Semgrep Rule Variant Creator

Port existing Semgrep rules to new target languages with proper applicability analysis and test-driven validation.

## When to Use
**Ideal scenarios:**
- Porting an existing Semgrep rule to one or more target languages
- Creating language-specific variants of a universal vulnerability pattern
- Expanding rule coverage across a polyglot codebase
- Translating rules between languages with equivalent constructs

## When NOT to Use

Do NOT use this skill for:
- Creating a new Semgrep rule from scratch (use `semgrep-rule-creator` instead)
- Running existing rules against code
- Languages where the vulnerability pattern fundamentally doesn't apply
- Minor syntax variations within the same language

## Input Specification

This skill requires:
1. **Existing Semgrep rule** - YAML file path or YAML rule content
2. **Target languages** - One or more languages to port to (e.g., "Golang and Java")

## Output Specification

For each applicable target language, produces:
```
<original-rule-id>-<language>/
├── <original-rule-id>-<language>.yaml     # Ported Semgrep rule
└── <original-rule-id>-<language>.<ext>    # Test file with annotations
```

Example output for porting `sql-injection` to Go and Java:
```
sql-injection-golang/
├── sql-injection-golang.yaml
└── sql-injection-golang.go

sql-injection-java/
├── sql-injection-java.yaml
└── sql-injection-java.java
```

## Rationalizations to Reject

When porting Semgrep rules, reject these common shortcuts:

| Rationalization | Why It Fails | Correct Approach |
|-----------------|--------------|------------------|
| "Pattern structure is identical" | Different ASTs across languages | Always dump AST for target language |
| "Same vulnerability, same detection" | Data flow differs between languages | Analyze target language idioms |
| "Rule doesn't need tests since original worked" | Language edge cases differ | Write NEW test cases for target |
| "Skip applicability - it obviously applies" | Some patterns are language-specific | Complete applicability analysis first |
| "I'll create all variants then test" | Errors compound, hard to debug | Complete full cycle per language |
| "Library equivalent is close enough" | Surface similarity hides differences | Verify API semantics match |
| "Just translate the syntax 1:1" | Languages have different idioms | Research target language patterns |

## Strictness Level

This workflow is **strict** - do not skip steps:
- **Applicability analysis is mandatory**: Don't assume patterns translate
- **Each language is independent**: Complete full cycle before moving to next
- **Test-first for each variant**: Never wri
