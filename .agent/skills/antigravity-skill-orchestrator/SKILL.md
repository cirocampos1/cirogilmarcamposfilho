# antigravity-skill-orchestrator

## Overview

The `skill-orchestrator` is a meta-skill designed to enhance the AI agent's ability to tackle complex problems. It acts as an intelligent coordinator that first evaluates the complexity of a user's request. Based on that evaluation, it determines if specialized skills are needed. If they are, it selects the right combination of skills, explicitly tracks these combinations using `@agent-memory-mcp` for future reference, and guides the agent through the execution process. Crucially, it includes strict guardrails to prevent the unnecessary use of specialized skills for simple tasks that can be solved with baseline capabilities.

## When to Use This Skill

- Use when tackling a complex, multi-step problem that likely requires multiple domains of expertise.
- Use when you are unsure which specific skills are best suited for a given user request, and need to discover them from the broader ecosystem.
- Use when the user explicitly asks to "orchestrate", "combine skills", or "use the best tools for the job" on a significant task.
- Use when you want to look up previously successful combinations of skills for a specific type of problem.

## Core Concepts

### Task Evaluation Guardrails
Not every task requires a specialized skill. For straightforward issues (e.g., small CSS fixes, simple script writing, renaming a variable), **DO NOT USE** specialized skills. Over-engineering simple tasks wastes tokens and time. 

Additionally, the orchestrator is strictly forbidden from creating new skills. Its sole purpose is to combine and use existing skills provided by the community or present in the current environment.

Before invoking any skills, evaluate the task:
1. **Is the task simple/contained?** Solve it directly using the agent's ordinary file editing, search, and terminal capabilities available in the current environment.
2. **Is the task complex/multi-domain?** Only then should you proceed to orchestrate skills.

### Skill Selection & Combinations
When a task is deemed complex, identify the necessary domains (e.g., frontend, database, deployment). Search available skills in the current environment to find the most relevant ones. If the required skills are not found locally, consult the master skill catalog.

### Master Skill Catalog
The Antigravity ecosystem maintains a master catalog of highly curated skills at `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills/main/CATALOG.md`. When local skills are insufficient, fetch this catalog to discover appropriate skills across the 9 primary categories:
