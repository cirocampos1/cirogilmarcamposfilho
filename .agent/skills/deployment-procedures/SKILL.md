# Deployment Procedures

> **Learn to THINK, not memorize scripts.**

## ⚠️ How to Use This Skill

This skill teaches **deployment principles**, not bash scripts to copy.

- Every deployment is unique
- Understand the WHY behind each step
- Adapt procedures to your platform

---

## 1. Platform Selection

### Decision Tree

```
What are you deploying?
│
├── Static site / JAMstack
│   └── Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages
│
├── Simple web app
│   ├── Managed → Railway, Render, Fly.io
│   └── Control → VPS + PM2/Docker
│
├── Microservices
│   └── Container orchestration
│
└── Serverless
    └── Edge functions, Lambda
```

### Each Platform Has Different Procedures

| Platform | Deployment Method |
|----------|------------------|
| **Vercel/Netlify** | Git push, auto-deploy |
| **Railway/Render** | Git push or CLI |
| **VPS + PM2** | SSH + manual steps |
| **Docker** | Image push + orchestration |
| **Kubernetes** | kubectl apply |

## 2. Pre-Deployment Principles

### The 4 Verification Categories

| Category | What to Check |
|----------|--------------|
| **Code Quality** | Tests passing, linting clean, reviewed |
| **Build** | Production build works, no warnings |
| **Environment** | Env vars set, secrets current |
| **Safety** | Backup done, rollback plan ready |

### Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Production build successful
- [ ] Environment variables verified
- [ ] Database migrations ready (if any)
- [ ] Rollback plan documented
- [ ] Team notified
- [ ] Monitoring ready

---

## 3. Deployment Workflow Principles

### The 5-Phase Process

```
1. PREPARE
   └── Verify code, build, env vars

2. BACKUP
   └── Save current state before changing

3. DEPLOY
   └── Execute with monitoring open

4. VERIFY
   └── Health check, logs, key flows

5. CONFIRM or ROLLBACK
   └── All good? Confirm. Issues? Rollback.
```

### Phase Principles

| Phase | Principle |
|-------|-----------|
| **Prepare** | Never deploy untested code |
| **Backup** | Can't rollback without backup |
| **Deploy** | Watch it happen, don't walk away |
| **Verify** | Trust but verify |
| **Confirm** | Have rollback trigger ready |

---

## 4. Post-Deployment Verification

### What to Verify

| Check | Why |
|-------|-----|
| **Health endpoint** | Service is running |
| **Error logs** | No new errors |
| **Key user flows** | Critical features work |
| **Performance** | Response times acceptable |

### Verification Window

- **First 5 minutes**: Active monitoring
- **15 minutes**: Confirm stable
- **1 hour**: Final verification
- **Next day**: Review metrics
